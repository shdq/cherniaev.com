The coding section on interviews is not about pure knowledge of algorithms and data structures. Good interviewers look for signals from candidates, like problem-solving, technical competency, communication skills, etc. So my goal is to develop a habit of providing better signals while solving coding problems on a training platform. I use [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) as the industry standard, and this is my training process.

## Time is important

Time flies, especially on interviews. On average, you have about 45 minutes for coding out of an hour interview. To get used to it, use a timer while solving a problem.  I noticed that 30 minutes timer helps me to be ready for such a tight timeframe.

## Understand the problem

Take your time to read it carefully and repeat it back to your imaginary interviewer. I use a [rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) as my interviewer. Ask for clarification. What with the format and range of the input? As an answer, you have examples and constraints sections on the platform, don't ignore them. Get through a small example to ensure that you grasp the problem.

## Devise a plan

First, describe an idea of how you are going to solve the problem. Explain it even if it is a brute force with the O(n<sup>2</sup>) time complexity. Second, try to improve your previous idea and come up with a better solution. You don't need an actual paper use comments in an editor to write down the idea. When you finish your algorithm, tell about the time and space complexity and that you are ready to write code.

*If you are stuck figuring out a solution, try to recall similar problems and how did you solve them. If you are still stuck, check for a hint on the platform.*

## Communicate while coding

It is time to write code. Explain everything you are coding and what you want to achieve. Type at a reasonable pace, use proper variable names and indentation, extract functions if needed, show knowledge of a programming language you use, be proactive. When you finished, don't push the «run» button right away or tell that you have done coding on an interview.

## Check the code

Look at your code and check for errors, like array boundaries in a loop, redundant conditions, missing semicolon or parenthesis, etc. Go step-by-step through your code with the examples you have, then create some more inputs to check edge cases. If you are short on time, explain where you cut corners and what you would do in another way to make the code better.

## Run the code

If the solution is accepted, well done. If it doesn't, return to the previous paragraph.

*Sometimes interviewers prefer to use Google Docs or similar as a code editor, so there is no «run» button. Therefore, you tell the interviewer that you finished coding.*

## Do the homework

Use a stylesheet to record the problem you have solved, and briefly review the solution, data structure, and algorithm you used. It will help you to prepare right before an interview.
